# Conclusion:
In this project, I explored several datasets and used data cleaning and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling. I then applied various regression and classification algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, SVC, random forests, and neural networks, to train our predictive model. I evaluated the accuracy of our model using metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared score, and precision, and compared the results to baseline models and other models to assess their performance.

Overall, I can be concluded that the random forest regression model is a more accurate predictor of the overall cost of a laptop than the linear regression model. The random forest model outperformed the linear regression model in terms of R2 score and MSE, indicating a stronger capacity for prediction. 

I also found below features having strong correlation with price of the laptop(list in decreasing order):
Ram, SSD, ppi(pixel count), CPU brand
