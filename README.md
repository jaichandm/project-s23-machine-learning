# Laptop price prediction

The objective of this machine learning project is to predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications and features such as CPU, RAM, screen size, storage, brand, etc.

__Note:__ Switched to Laptop price prediction instead of project on Boston House Prices

### Features of importance:
Features that might be important in predicting laptop prices include:

* Brand: some brands may have a higher perceived value and therefore command a higher price
* Processor: faster processors generally cost more than slower ones
* RAM: more RAM may indicate a higher-end laptop and therefore a higher price
* Storage: larger storage capacities may command a higher price
* Screen Size: larger screens may command a higher price
* Graphics Card: a dedicated graphics card may indicate a higher-end laptop and therefore a higher price
* Operating System: certain operating systems, such as macOS, may command a higher price than others

### Potential useful feature combinations:
Some combinations of features that may be useful in predicting laptop prices include:

Processor and RAM: faster processors and more RAM may indicate a higher-end laptop and therefore a higher price
Graphics Card and Processor: a dedicated graphics card and a faster processor may indicate a gaming laptop or high-performance laptop and therefore a higher price
Storage and Brand: certain brands may command a higher price for larger storage capacities.
### Expected Answer/Output:
The goal is to create a model that can assist consumers in making informed decisions about purchasing laptops by providing them with an estimated price range based on the laptop's specifications.

Design a predictive model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its features and specifications.
The model will take in the relevant laptop features, such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, screen size, graphics card, and operating system, and output a predicted price for the laptop.
The model will be trained on the available laptop price dataset and evaluated for its accuracy in predicting prices for new laptops with similar features.
